#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 20.
#     For example, [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3] becomes [2, 18, 12, 3].

numbers = [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3]
smaller_numbers = []
numbers.each do |number| 
  if number < 20
    smaller_numbers << number
  end
end

# p smaller_numbers


#  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that start with the letter "w".
#     For example, ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"] becomes ["winner", "winner"].

strings = ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"]
w_strings = strings.select do |string|
  string[0] == "w"
end

# p w_strings


#  3. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices greater than 5 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}].

items = [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}]

#  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the even numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [2, 4, 8].

numbers = [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7]
even_numbers = numbers.select do |number|
  number.even?
end

# p even_numbers


#  5. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings shorter than 4 letters.
#     For example, ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal", "panama"] becomes ["a", "man", "a", "a"].

strings = ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal", "panama"]
shorter_strings = strings.select do |string|
  string.length < 4
end

# p shorter_strings

#  6. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with names shorter than 6 letters (from the :name key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "book", price: 4}].
items = [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}]
shorter_named_items = items.select do |item|
  item[:name].length < 6
end

# p shorter_named_items


#  7. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 10.
#     For example, [8, 23, 0, 44, 1980, 3] becomes [8, 0, 3].

numbers = [8, 23, 0, 44, 1980, 3]
smaller_numbers = numbers.select { |number| number < 10 }

# p smaller_numbers

#  8. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that don't start with the letter "b".
#     For example, ["big", "little", "good", "bad"] becomes ["little", "good"].

strings = ["big", "little", "good", "bad"]

no_b = strings.select { |string| string[0] != "b" }

# p no_b

#  9. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices less than 10 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}].

items = [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}]
cheaper_items = items.select { |item| item[:price] < 10 }

# p cheaper_items

# 10. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the odd numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [5, 1, 9, 7].

numbers = [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7]
odd_numbers = numbers.select { |number| number.odd? }
